Welcome to the JWKS Server project! This project takes a standard JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) server and supercharges it by adding SQLite for secure storage of private keys.
With this serverless database, your keys are safely stored and remain available even after restarts. Weâ€™ve also implemented strong protections against SQL injection attacks to keep your data safe.
The server features handy endpoints for generating JWTs and serving public keys, including options to manage key expiration.
